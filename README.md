# Library of Online Cognitive Tests Optimized for Mobile Devices

This was my final degree project in which the aim of this project is to create a series of cognitive tests to evaluate patients with possible cognitive impairment. It is a web application optimized for mobile devices with a total of seven different tests.
In the application, the user will be able to register his data and choose one of the tests. These tests store a series of parameters on an REST server for future analysis by a medical professional. Parameters are stored to simulate the userâ€™s interaction with the application and measure the different cognitive capacities of the individual: memory, computational capacity, and hand-eye coordination, among others.
The tests are composed of an image memorization test, followed by a test of dragging an object to its corresponding place, then memorizing some words, next a mathematical computation, continued by pressing a circle, then detecting a ball until reaching the end of a path, and finally an implementation of a MOCA test.
This report aims to collect everything related to the development of this work. It will begin with an introduction, in which the main motivations and objectives will be presented. It will continue by analyzing similar applications in the literature, as well as the tools that have been used in the project.
After that, everything related to the implementation of the application will be discussed. Starting with the requirements and use cases of each test and ending with the design, interface, use, and storage of parameters of each test.
Finally, the results obtained after the work will be analyzed and a study of the impact of this project will be made.
